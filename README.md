To build a working AITempleOS:

1. Build a stable Linux kernel. AITempleOS is based on Linux kernel, so it is important to have a stable and secure version of the kernel to use as the foundation of the operating system.
  
2. Write the necessary scripts and code to customize the kernel and add the desired functionality. This may include scripts for hardware initialization, memory management, and system calls.
  
3. Create a basic system structure, such as file and directory hierarchy, which defines the organization of files and directories on the filesystem.
  
4. Add support for libraries and tools that the operating system will need to run. These may include the standard C library and tools for compilation and debugging.
  
5. Implement support for the Holy Lua scripting language. This includes creating a Lua interpreter and integrating it into the operating system.
  
6. Create an installer for the operating system, which will make it easy for users to install and set up AITempleOS on their systems.
  
7. Test the operating system on a wide range of hardware configurations to ensure compatibility and stability.
  
8. Create user and developer documentation, including a user guide and a developer guide to provide more detailed information on how to use the operating system.
  
9. Implement AI based system update and maintenance services. This includes AI's ability to update the system and fix errors, as well as the ability to share updates over a P2P network on a blockchain.
  
10. Release the operating system to the public and continue to maintain and improve it over time.
  

Please note that this is just an idea of the steps that may be involved in building AITempleOS, and the actual process will depend on the development and design of the OS.
